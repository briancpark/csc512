% Question 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{1}

% Question 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{2}
Consider the following grammar:

\begin{Parts}
	\Part Does this grammar has left recursions? If you believe so, try to rewrite the grammar to remove left recursions; the new grammar should describe the same set of expressions as the original grammar does.
	\Part Is the original grammar a LL(1) grammar? Justify your answer.
\end{Parts}

% Question 3
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{3}
Write a grammar to describe all binary numbers that are multiples of four. Note:
0 is a multiple of 4.
The binary number is unsigned (i.e., it contains no sign bit).
It should not contain leading 0s. For instance 00100 is not legal, but 100 is.
