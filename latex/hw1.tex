% Question 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{1}
Describe informally the languages accepted by the following \verb|FAS|:

b.
\begin{Answer}
It only has one end state. It represents any pattern of \verb|1|s or \verb|0|s, but doesn't have a pattern for \verb|10| or \verb|01| after $s_1$ and $s_2$ which will be followed by a sequence of \verb|00| and \verb|11| respectively.
\end{Answer}

c.
\begin{Answer}
Will contain a lot of \verb|a|'s and \verb|b|'s. Subset of \verb|aab| and \verb|baa| will appear.
\end{Answer}

\section*{2}
Construct an \verb|FA| accepting each of the following languages: \\

b. $w \in \{0, 1\}^* | w$ contains `111' as a substring and does not contain `00' as a substring

c. $w \in \{a, b, c\}^* | \in w$ the number of $a$'s modulo 2 is equal to the number of $b$'s modulo 3

% Question 4
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{4}
Different programming languages use different notations to represent integers. Construct a regular expression for each one of the following: \\

c. Currency, in dollars, represented as a positive decimal number rounded to the nearest one-hundredth. Such numbers begin with the character \$, have commas separating each group of three digits to the left of the decimal point, and end with two digits to the right of the decimal point, for example, \$8,937.43 and \$7,777,777.77.

\begin{Answer}
$$\$\Big([1\cdots9]([0\cdots9] | \epsilon)([0\cdots9] | \epsilon)(,[0\cdots9][0\cdots9][0\cdots9])^*\Big|0\Big).[0\cdots9][0\cdots9]$$
\end{Answer}

% Question 5
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section*{5}
Write a regular expression for each of the following languages: \\ 

e. Given an alphabet $\Sigma = \{+, -, \times, \div, (,), \verb|id|\}$, $L$ is the set of algebraic expressions using addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and parentheses over \verb|id|s.

\begin{Answer}
$$L = \verb|id|\Big((+ | - | \times | \div)\verb|id|\Big)^+$$

An exception is that parenthesis cannot be matched with regular expression.
